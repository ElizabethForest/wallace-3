## Wallace Initiative

![CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/jcu-eresearch/wallace-3.svg?branch=master) 

The Wallace Initiative brings together experts in biodiversity (JCU, UEA), and climate change impacts and adaptation (UEA, JCU), with large datasets on the occurrence of biodiversity (GBIF) and the High Performance Computing Cluster and expertise at JCU to look at the potential impacts of climate change on global terrestrial biodiversity.  To date the project has generated 1 petabyte of data. If that petabyte was music it could play continuously for 2000 years, if it was video it would fill 223,000 DVDs or more than 13 years of HD video, if text it would fill 20 million four-drawer filing cabinets.  In other words it is a LOT of data on biodiversity and climate change.

Details on running the webapp are in `webapp/README.md`
